# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The following includes an analysis of Kickstarter campaign data for campaigns launched between October 2010 and February 2017. The analysis provides information on the success rate of campaigns based on category. Further analysis of the data provided an ideal goal amount, launch date and campaign length outlined below with the following graphs.

## Additional Analysis and Limitations
Additional analysis we can provide to Louise could include the impact of staff picks and spotlights had on the success of a campaign and whether those were more likely to gain more backers or increased pledge amounts. Based on available data, we would be able to determine which countries were more likely to support theater campaigns, however more data would need to be gathered to narrow down a specific geographic location within a country to recommend to Louise.
